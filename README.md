# Honors-Engagement-Project
This is my analysis of engagement for the UCLA Honors Program on two of their Instagram accounts

I did this project in collaboration with Honors Fellow Mary Jasmine Lara, who helped with the collection of data and used the data to implement changes in the UCLA Honors Program

This is my first personal project outside of schoolwork, and I am attempting to improve my skills of data collection, analysis, and graphing in R
